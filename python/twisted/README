work.py is hardcoded to expect home.py to be running on student02.cse.nd.edu, but this can easily be changed using the global variable, host, at the top of work.py.

The port used for the client connection in home.py is 9001. Again, this can be changed using the global variable, clientPort, at the top of home.py.
